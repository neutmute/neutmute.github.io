excerpt: Even more EmguCV on the Raspberry Pi
---
<p>It is getting even easier to build EmguCv and OpenCV for the Raspberry Pi. Recent commits to EmguCV have added build support for Raspbian. From commit [1fa5e56] I only had to follow the <a href="http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Download_And_Installation#Raspbian_.28Raspberry_Pi_2.29_2">EmguCV instructions</a> with a minor tweak.</p>
<p>At near 100% complete compilation, there was an error</p>
<pre><span style="color: #ff6600;">fatal error: opencv2/hal/defs.h: No such file or directory </span></pre>
<p>which I solved with</p>
<pre><span style="color: #339966;">mkdir ~/emgucv/opencv/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/opencv2/hal -p</span>

<span style="color: #339966;">cp ~/emgucv/opencv/modules/hal/include/opencv2/hal/defs.h ~/emgucv/opencv/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/opencv2/hal</span></pre>
<p>Note that EmguCV's CMAKE builds OpenCV with TBB=FALSE - disabling support for Intel's Thread Building Blocks. TBB isn't available on Raspian's ARM hard float Wheezy at the time of writing (via apt-get package management at least). I plan to get this going at some point though. Face detection in OpenCV uses the <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/modules/objdetect/doc/cascade_classification.html">detectMultiScale </a>method which should get a nice speed boost on the Raspberry Pi 2 when TBB is enabled.</p>
