excerpt: What I did to fix our misbehaving Roboking
---
Our Korean imported Roboking VR6272LVM started acting up and refusing to clean.
The symptoms were

- Turn the robot on
- It starts rotating on the spot
- After a few rotations it announces cleaning is complete and tries to find the home station
- If the home station is turned on it just rotates forever
- If the home station is off it declares it can't find the homestation and turns off

Some Internet posts suggested cleaning the sensors but they weren't dirty. I decided to risk downloading firmware from the [English LG website](http://www.lg.com/au/support-product/lg-VR6270LVMB) for the Korean model. It announced software was loading and finished with "`13865 software is loaded`"

After turning the robot off to remove the USB and turning it back on, it was back to its normal behaviour. So far so good!
I can't think of what the explanation might be** but at least I can spend time writing blog posts instead of sweeping floors.

** One thing I did recently was invert the robot to replace a broken sweeper. I wouldn't have thought that would cause a problem though
