excerpt: Dismantling the Roboking VR6272LVM
---
<p>I needed to repair my Roboking VR6272LVM but couldn't find any guides on how to take it apart. Here is what I worked out.</p>
<p>Take a reasonably thick (not jewellers - too thin) flat head screwdriver and insert it from the inside through the 1cm gap in the body (see position 1 in the diagram).</p>
<p><img class="" src="/assets/img/blog/RobokingDisassemble.jpg" alt="Screwdriver insertion points" width="625" height="625" /></p>
<p>Work the screwdriver in so that it has levered up the the plastic cover on the outside as well.</p>
<p>While leaving that screwdriver in place, get a second small flat head screwdriver and insert from the opposite side (2). Start working it gently down and around the edge (3).The latches should start popping out easily.</p>
<p>Once done on the outside, start working around the inside edge which also has some latches.</p>
<p>Now the cover can be removed revealing around 6 standard Philips head screws. Removing these allows the shell to be separated and disassembly is straight forward from there.</p>
